<h2>Add a new Facility</h2>
<!-- Content specific to the  page -->

    Please review the already existing <a href="{% url 'buildings' %}" class="btn-small">Buildings</a> before creating a new facility.
    Someone might have already added the facility and you could create a Room or Level within that Facility to help others in a more
    detailed manner.
